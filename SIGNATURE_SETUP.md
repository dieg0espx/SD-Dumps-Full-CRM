# Signature Functionality Setup

This document explains how to set up the digital signature functionality for the booking system.

## Database Setup

1. Run the database migration to add the `signature` column to the bookings table:
   ```sql
   -- Run the script: scripts/030_update_signature_to_blob.sql
   ```

## Signature Storage (Binary Blob in Database)

The signature functionality stores signatures as **binary blob data** directly in the database `signature` BYTEA column.

### No Storage Buckets Required

✅ **No Supabase storage bucket needed**  
✅ **No RLS policy issues**  
✅ **No permission problems**  
✅ **Works immediately**  
✅ **More efficient than text storage**  

### How It Works

1. User signs on the canvas
2. Signature is converted to a base64 data URL
3. Data URL is converted to binary blob data (Uint8Array)
4. Blob data is stored directly in the `signature` BYTEA column as binary
5. No file uploads or storage buckets required

### Benefits

- **Simple Setup**: No storage configuration needed
- **No Permissions Issues**: Works without any storage bucket setup
- **Reliable**: No RLS policy or upload failures
- **Self-Contained**: All signature data stored in your database

## Features Added

### 1. Signature Pad Component (`components/signature-pad.tsx`)
- Canvas-based signature capture
- Touch and mouse support
- Clear and save functionality
- Responsive design

### 2. Booking Form Updates (`components/booking-form.tsx`)
- Added step 6: Digital Signature
- Signature converted to binary blob
- Signature blob stored directly in bookings table
- Updated form validation and flow

### 3. Database Schema
- Added `signature` BYTEA column to `bookings` table
- Stores binary blob data of the signature image

## How It Works

1. User completes booking form through steps 1-5
2. In step 6, user signs on the canvas
3. Signature is converted to binary blob data
4. Blob data is stored directly in the `signature` BYTEA column
5. Booking is completed with signature attached
6. No external storage or buckets involved

## File Structure

```
components/
├── signature-pad.tsx          # Signature canvas component
└── booking-form.tsx           # Updated with signature step

scripts/
└── 030_update_signature_to_blob.sql  # Database migration
```

## Testing

1. **Run the database migration**: Execute `scripts/030_update_signature_to_blob.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. **Test the booking flow**: Go through the booking process to ensure signature capture works
3. **Verify signature storage**: Check that signature blob data is saved in the `signature` BYTEA column
4. **No storage setup needed**: The system works without any storage bucket configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Signature not saving**: Check that the `signature` BYTEA column exists in the bookings table
- **Database errors**: Ensure the database migration script was run successfully
- **Canvas not working**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Benefits of Blob Storage

- **No Storage Issues**: Completely bypasses Supabase storage permission problems
- **Simple Setup**: Only requires the database migration script
- **Reliable**: No upload failures or RLS policy issues
- **Self-Contained**: All signature data is stored in your database
- **More Efficient**: Binary blob storage is more efficient than base64 text
- **Better Performance**: No encoding/decoding overhead

## Security Considerations

- Signatures are stored as binary blob data
- All signature data is contained within the database
- No external storage dependencies
- Consider implementing RLS policies for the bookings table
- Consider adding signature expiration or cleanup policies
